## NativeScript XML Snippets for Visual Studio Code ##

This JSON file contains snippets for all NativeScript UI components and some frequently used attributes.

All UI components are prefixed with ```ns```. Attributes do not have a prefix.

## How to use? ##
For Windows:
```bash
%APPDATA%\Code\User\snippets
```

For Linux:
```bash
path\to\Code\User\snippets
```

Replace the ```xml.json``` file with this one or in case you already have other XML snippets,
append the contents of my file to yours.
